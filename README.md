# Frontaria games

## What is this?
This is a collection of short text-based games written in python.

## What's Fronteria?
Fronteria is the mythical world fulled with tech, big corporations, and the urge for everyone to get more money...

## So how do I play?

If you do not have git installed you might want to run:

```bash

pi@raspberry ~ $sudo apt-get install git

```

Ok, with that out of the way, we can first make sure we are in the home folder.

```bash

pi@raspberry ~ $cd ~

```

Now we can pull this repo from github.

```bash

pi@raspberry ~ $git clone git@github.com:kriekprinsloo/frontaria_games.git

```

When it's done, change your directory to fronteria_games, like this:

```bash

pi@raspberry ~ $cd fronteria_games

```

And run a game with python

```bash

pi@raspberry ~ $python name_of_game.py

```

And there you go!  Have fun!
